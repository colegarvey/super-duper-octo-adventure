Only run this cell if necessary as the current version will overwrite any data `.csv` files previously created by running this cell.  If this cell has not been run then there should be no worries as is will create the necessary files.  Data can be selectively collected and written by passing a '1' for the desired categories of data.  It might be best to run the cell with a single valid argument as it will take a long time to complete.  \n",
